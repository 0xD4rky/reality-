# REALITY: A Deep Fake Detection using PyTorch and Streamlit

## Project Overview

This project implements a deep fake detection system using PyTorch for the model backend and Streamlit for the user interface. It allows users to upload images and determine whether they are real or artificially generated (deep fakes).

## Features

- Upload images for deep fake detection
- Real-time prediction using a pre-trained PyTorch model
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit
- Displays prediction probabilities for both real and fake classifications
- Shows model architecture summary
