# DeepFake Detection

## Project Overview
This project implements multiple deep learning architectures so as to detect fake images or ai generated images. The application is built with PyTorch and Streamlit, providing an interactive web interface for users to upload and analyze images.

## Features
- Utilizes a fine-tuned VGG16 model for high-accuracy deepfake detection
- Interactive web interface for easy image upload and analysis
- Real-time prediction with probability scores for real and fake classifications
- Model architecture summary display
